Is this the real life Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide no escape from reality
Open your eyes look up to the skies and see
Im just a poor boy I need no sympathy
Because Im easy come easy go
Little high little low
Any way the wind blows doesnt really matter to me to me
Mama just killed a man
Put a gun against his head pulled my trigger now hes dead
Mama life had just begun
But now Ive gone and thrown it all away
Mama ooh didnt mean to make you cry
If Im not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine bodys aching all the time
Goodbye everybody Ive got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama ooh any way the wind blows
I dont wanna die
I sometimes wish Id never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche Scaramouche will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo Figaro magnifico
But Im just a poor boy nobody loves me
Hes just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
No we will not let you go let him go
We will not let you go let him go 
We will not let you go let me go
Will not let you go let me go
Will not let you go never never never never let me go

Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me for me for me

Id sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made em laugh you made em cry
You made us feel like we could fly radio
So dont become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just dont know or just dont care
And just complain when youre not there
You had your time you had the power
Youve yet to have your finest hour
